# consensus_swc
Derived from xiaoxiaol's [consensus_skeleton_2](https://github.com/Vaa3D/vaa3d_tools/tree/master/hackathon/xiaoxiaol/consensus_skeleton_2)

To mark its difference with the default v3d released plugin consensus_skeleton, it's named consensus_swc, same as its plugin func and folder name.

See help in `consensus_skeleton_func.cpp` for usage.
